                <h3>Bachelor Student in Computer Science</h3>
                A versatile and curious student,<br>
                I am currently studying computer science<br> 
                at the University of Bordeaux.

                As someone who is passionate about computer science, I am always looking for new projects to work on,<br>
                even though I often don't have the opportunity to finish them all, I always enjoy to learn new things.<br>
                Putting in practice what I learn is something that I find very important,<br> 
                and that is why I am always looking for new projects to work on.<br>
                Today my main focus is on the SSL team NAMEC, where I am working on the software of a robot for the SSL league.<br>
